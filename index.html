          <p>A Handy TODO system.
          </p>
          <p>I like turning complicated tasks in to simple subtasks. And for my household, I have a million small things to do.
            As both my memory is not perfect anymore, and i'm kind of a procrastinator, it's easy to forget small things.
            So, this system helps me in both dividing large endeavours in small manageable parts, 
            and to keep small tedeous from the back of my mind on the agenda.

            Royal Talens Cobra water mixable oil paint is my favorite paint.
            I often sleep in the same room as where my paintings are drying.
            So the complete lack of toxins and terpentine come as a miracle to me

          <h3>"Intelligence"</h3>
          <h4>September 2019</h4>
          <p>Green & Blues in Acrylics.
          </p>
          <p>Back in 2012, I began working on this piece.
            The darkest color green has been painted over at least six times. Tried Prussian, Kobalt, Sapgreen, Ultra, etc.
            Unfortunately the colors i used (on this sixth attempt ;) are not easy to capture on camera.
            There is no dark blue being used, it's a Turqoise Blue.
            <br>
            And it's even brighter and more saturated then it is in the sample i added below the photo.
            As always, i'm showing it to you before it's finished. 
            <br>
            The black lines need the most of my attention.

        <article class="articleboerentoren">
          <h3>"Boerentoren"</h3>
          <h4>Juli, 2018</h4>
          <p>While i was watching the show "White Collar",<br> I saw a painting passing by that really intrigued me.<br>
            It was an Art Deco painting of the Chrystler building.<br>
            After some research, I found 2 paintings that i wanted to use as an inspirational assist for my own painting.<br>
            The tower i'm painting, is the iconic "Boerentoren", in my hometown of Antwerp.<br>
            It is also known as the "KBC Tower", as that's the name of the bank that's currently housed in it.
          </p>
          <p>Making it 75 x 100 cm in Acrylics, it is quite a lengthy job. Combining it with my dayjob and other works of art, 
            we're 3 years in the making...
          </p>
          <h5>Here are the two examples:</h5>

          <div class="whitecollar">
            <img src="assets/img/whitecollar.png">
            <p>This painting is from the series.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="whitecopy">
            <img src="assets/img/whitecopy.jpg">
            <p>This is another one in the same style.
            </p>
          </div>  

          <div class="boerentoren">
            <h5>And here's my version so far:</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/boerentoren.jpg">
            <p>I can't wait to see where it goes. I have changed the sun several times.<br> 
              From red flames on it with Egyptian Hieroglyphs, 
              to one that shoots solar flares. In the end, i believe that less is more. 
              Therefore i changed it back by overpainting it with cadmiumyellow.</p>
