        <h3>Hi, I'm Frank.</h3>
        <h4>Juli, 2018</h4>
        <p>I created this website, because i want to share my artwork with you. As an artist, 
          we get the tendency to stay in the safe harbor of our workshop, and therefore we don't meet a lot of people.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Most of my work is done with Acrylics, Water-miscible oil paint, and Pyrography art.
          I really love Royal Talens' products, and as you get used to certain qualities and behaviour of paints, it helps to stay with that brand.
        </p>
        <p>  
          My first work with paint, (besides the kindergarden days) was a decade ago with an old refrigerator that was covered in brown rust on the outside.     
          I was 'poor' at the time, and had to settle with this free gift.
          I took a cheap set of paint that i had laying around from the dollarstore, and painted a sky with some clouds.
          The next week, i went to the local artsupplies store, and spend the little money i had on some more colors.
          The first year i only painted on user items,
          I liked the fact that when i would use these painted items i'd be reminded of the fun i had while i was painting them.
        </p>
        <p>  
          After that i went for canvasses, as the wear and tear of using my decorated pieces often damaged the paint.
          I started with PopArt, and now 10 years further i am slowly moving towards oil portraits.
          Almost as fun as creating stuff, is getting lost in the endless aisles of my local artsupplies store. 
          On one of these occasions I stumbled upon the woodcrafts section.
          For a mere &euro;15 i found a Pyrography tool.
          Since I lived as a nightwatch on the grounds of the large printing company where i worked as a printing press operator, 
          i had an near-endless supply of recycled wood in the outside dumpsters.
          These days the wood gets harder to come by, but i still enjoy burning wood. 
          I probably spend as much time in the smoke of burning wood, as i do sniffin' paint fumes.
