          <p>I stumbled upon this photo on a "Pastel Goth" site.<br>
            I just could'nt stop myself from grabbing my paints and brushes together, and to have a go for it...<br>
            2 weeks later, this is what ended up on the spare canvas that i had lying around.

          <p>The last painting (picture 8), is not finished yet. As i currently spend a lot of time on my studies, 
            it might take a while before i have time to get to work on it.<br> So I could'nt stop myself from sharing it with you in advance.

          <h3>"Boerentoren"</h3>
          <h4>Juli, 2018</h4>
          <p>While i was watching the show "White Collar",<br> I saw a painting passing by that really intrigued me.<br>
            It was an Art Deco painting of the Chrystler building.<br>
            After some research, I found 2 paintings that i wanted to use as an inspirational assist for my own painting.<br>
            The tower i'm painting, is the iconic "Boerentoren", in my hometown of Antwerp.<br>
            It is also known as the "KBC Tower", as that's the name of the bank that's currently housed in it.<br>
            Making it 75 x 100 cm in Acrylics, it is quite a lengthy job. Combining it with my dayjob and other works of art, we're 3 years in the making...
          </p>
          <h5>Here are the two examples:</h5>

          <div class="whitecollar">
            <img src="assets/img/whitecollar.png">
            <p>This painting is from the series.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="whitecopy">
            <img src="assets/img/whitecopy.jpg">
            <p>This is another one in the same style.
            </p>
          </div>  

          <div class="boerentoren">
            <h5>And here's my version so far:</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/boerentoren.jpg">
            <p>I can't wait to see where it goes. I have changed the sun several times.<br> From red flames on it with Egyptian Hieroglyphs, to one that shoots solar flares. In the end, i believe that less is more. Therefore i changed it back by overpainting it with cadmiumyellow.</p>
