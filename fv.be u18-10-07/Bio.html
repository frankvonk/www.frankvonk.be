		<h3>Hi, I'm Frank.</h3>
		<p>	I created this website, because i want to share my artwork with you. As an artist, 
			we get the tendency to stay in the safe harbor of our workshop, and therefore we don't meet a lot of people.
<br>Most of my work is done with Acrylics, Water-miscible oil paint, and Pyrography art.
<br>I really love Royal Talens' products, and as you get used to certain qualities and behaviour of paints, it helps to stay with that brand.<br>
<br>My first work with paint, (besides the kindergarden days) was a decade ago with an old refrigerator that was covered in brown rust on the outside.<br>
I was 'poor' at the time, and had to settle with this free gift.<br> 
I took a cheap set of paint that i had laying around from the dollarstore, and painted a sky with some clouds.
<br> The next week, i went to the local artsupplies store, and spend the little money i had on some more colors.
The first year i only painted on user items,<br>
I liked the fact that when i would use these items i'd be reminded of the fun i had while painting it. <br
>After that i went for canvasses, as the wear and tear of using my decorated pieces often damaged the paint.
<br> <br>I started with PopArt, and now 10 years further i am slowly moving towards oil portraits.
</p>
<p>Almost as fun as creating stuff, is getting lost in the endless aisles of my local artsupplies store. 
	On one of these occasions I stumbled upon the woodcrafts section.<br> For a mere &euro;15 i found a Pyrography tool.<br>
	Since I lived as a doorman on the grounds of the large printing company where i worked as a printing press operator, 
	i had an near-endless supply of recycled wood in the outside dumpsters.
These days the wood gets harder to come by, but i still enjoy burning wood. <br>I probably spend as much time in the smoke of burning wood, as i do sniffin' paints.   </p>
