	<p>Personal Portrait in Acrylics.

		I just could'nt stop myself from grabbing my paints together, and go for it...<br>
		2 weeks later, this is what ended up on the spare canvas that i had lying around.

   <h3>"Boerentoren"	September, 2018</h3>
  <p>While i was watching the show "white Collar", I saw a painting passing by that really intrigued me.<br>
  It was an Art Deco painting of the Chrystler building.<br>
  After some research, I found 2 paintings that i wanted to use as an inspirational assist for my own painting.<br>
  The tower i'm painting, is the iconic "Boerentoren", in my hometown of Antwerp.<br>
  It is also known as the "KBC Tower", as that's the name of the bank that's currently housed in it.<br>
  Making it 75 x 100 cm in Acrylics, it is quite a lengthy job. Combining it with my dayjob and other works of art, we're 3 years in the making...
  </p>
<h3>Here are the two examples:</h3>

  <div class="whitecollar">
	<img src="assets/img/whitecollar.png" height="260px" width="200px">
	<p>This painting is from the series
	</p>
  </div>

	<div class="whitecopy">
	  <img src="assets/img/whitecopy.jpg" height="260px" width="200px">
	  <p>This is another one in the same style
	  </p>
	</div>  

	<div class="boerentoren">
		<h3>And here's my version so far:</h3>
		<img src="assets/img/boerentoren.jpg" height="550px" width="435px">
		<p>I can't wait to see where it goes. I have changed the sun several times, from red flames on it with Egyptian Hieroglyphs, to one that shoots solar flares. In the end, i believe that less is more. Therefore i changed it back by overpainting it with cadmiumyellow.</p>
